<h3>Many believe that God Shiva is a Sayambhu â€“ which means He is not born from a human body. He was created automatically! He was there when there was nothing and He will remain even after everything is destructed. That is why; he is also loving called as the 'Adi-Dev' which means the 'Oldest God of the Hindu mythology.</h3>
